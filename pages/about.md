My name is Tom Johnson, and I'm a technical writer, blogger, and podcaster based in San Jose, California. My blog is here: [http://idratherbewriting.com](http://idratherbewriting.com). I write several posts there a week. See [my blog's about page](http://idratherbewriting.com/aboutme/) for more details about me.

I'm using this theme in a pilot with some technical documentation projects. The theme is evolving, but it's stable enough for release.
