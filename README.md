# Documentation theme for Jekyll 

This is a Jekyll theme designed to be used for single-sourced documentation sites. Instructions for using the theme are in the site build. You can see the site build in the following two locations:

* [http://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/designer/](http://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/designer/)
* [http://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/writer/](http://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/writer/)

The two different builds demonstrate the single-source publishing capabilities of the theme. The designer version is comprehensive, whereas the writer version is a subset of the designer version.
